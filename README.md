# Inverted-Pendulum
Inverted pendulums are classic examples of inherently unstable systems. In control systems engineering, the goal is to stabilize such systems and guide them toward desired behaviors. This project explores two control strategies to balance a two-link inverted pendulum.

## Features
- Implementation of two control methods for stabilization
- Simulation and visualization of the pendulum's behavior
- Focus on long-duration balancing (10 minutes target)

## Requirements
- [ ] Achieve stable balance for 10 minutes
- [ ] Simulate PID and LQR
- [ ] Visualize pedulum dynamics
- [ ] Analyze and compare control performance
### Stretch goals
- [ ] Control pendulum over web interface
- [ ] Swap between control strategies on the fly
